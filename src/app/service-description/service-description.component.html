  <h3>Service Description</h3>
  <p>The SharePoint PnP Provisioning Service lets you add samples, templates and solutions to your Office 365 tenant.</p>
  <p>The service provisions content and configuration for site collections, sites, and tenants as documented in each sample, template and solution. We strongly recommend deploying to a test tenant so that you can carefully analyze the results before deploying to your production tenant.</p>
  <p>This is an open source community hosted service, so there is no direct support from Microsoft from standard support channels for this service or for the contents of samples, templates, and solutions. You can however get support by reporting any issues using the process defined later in this document.</p>
  <h4>Using the SharePoint PnP Provisioning Service</h4>
  <p>To use the service, browse the catalog and select a template. Read the template documentation to understand the template's possible prerequisites, credential requirements, and customizations.</p>
  <h5>PREREQUISITES</h5>
  <p>Some templates have prerequisites including permissions to the term store or other configuration. Ensure that the prerequisites are met, otherwise provisioning might fail.</p>
  <h5>CREDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS</h5>
  <p>To add a template to your tenant, you must be authenticated with appropriate tenant administrative credentials (SharePoint admin account is not sufficient) as specified in the template documentation.</p>
  <h5>CUSTOMIZATIONS</h5>
  <p>The SharePoint PnP Provisioning Service uses PnP tenant templates, and customizations include one or more of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sample pages and images</li>
    <li>Sample news articles</li>
    <li>Office documents as a sample content</li>
    <li>Site designs and site scripts, which are applied at the tenant scope and will be available throughout the tenant</li>
    <li>Tenant themes</li>
    <li>SharePoint Framework solutions with web parts and extensions</li>
    <li>Microsoft Graph or 3rd party API permissions</li>
    <li>Tenant taxonomy settings</li>
    <li>Hub site configuration</li>
    <li>Site collections</li>
  </ul>
  <p>After evaluating the sample, template or solution, deploy it to your environment by clicking <strong>Add to your tenant</strong>. We strongly recommend deploying to a test tenant so that you can carefully analyze the results before deploying to your production tenant. You will be required to log in to your tenant with appropriate credentials.</p>
  <p>Provisioning operations are NOT transactional. If template provisioning is interrupted, the template might be only partially applied. In this case, you can either re-apply the template or manually delete content and revert configuration.</p>
  <h4>About the SharePoint PnP Provisioning Service</h4>
  <p>Each sample, template and solution is defined by a <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/blogs/pnp-webcast-introduction-to-pnp-tenant-templates/" rel="nofollow">PnP Tenant Template</a> that specifies content and configuration for the tenant, site collections, and sites. The PnP Template is deployed using the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRbrrGCfUtE" rel="nofollow">PnP Provisioning engine</a>, an open source community built engine which is also available as a CSOM extension or by using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-pnp/sharepoint-pnp-cmdlets" rel="nofollow">PnP PowerShell</a>.</p>
  <p>This is an open source community hosted service, so there is no support from Microsoft for this service or for the contents of samples, templates, and solutions.</p>
